### CLASS FORMAT

Class will be comprised of lectures, workshops, discussions, presentations, and critiques. 

Also, as a part of this course, students will participate in a mock job interview, go on an informational interview for an internship/job/other opportunity, and research a range of professional opportunities available to the Integrated Digital Media student. In addition to exploring these practical professional concerns, guest speakers will augment classroom activities.

Critiques are the best way to articulate your ideas to others and get immediate feedback. During the crit, the professor and your classmates analyze and suggest ways to increase the visual and conceptual impact of each existing idea. Take notes when your work is being critiqued and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not. Review your crit notes and reflect upon what was said. Ask yourself how you could combine, transform, or expand the ideas that show the most promise. However, resist the temptation to incorporate all suggestions and comments. Only utilize the ones that work for you and your project.

Rules of the Critique:
* Be Present and Engaged (In other words, close your laptops and put away your smart phones.)
* Give Feedback to your classmates
* Do NOT take feedback personally. (Crits are about making continuous improvement on whatever your working on.) 

### TECHNOLOGY

Laptop computers and other mobile devices are invaluable tools for artists, designers, and students when used responsibly. However, this technology can also be incredibly distracting, especially in the classroom. When in class, you may use your laptops and other devices for any activities pertaining to the course: taking notes, researching material relevant to our readings and discussions, doing professional practices homework, making class presentations, etc. However, the following uses are unacceptable: checking email, instant messaging, texting, using social networking sites such as facebook, etc. 

### COMMUNICATING WITH THE PROFESSOR OUTSIDE OF CLASS

* Direct message on Slack about logistics (when, where, how many?) ONLY
* Talk to me in person directly after class or [set up an appointment](https://calendly.com/deangela) about issues and problems. DO NOT direct message long conversations. (If your direct message turns into paragraphs that means you should be talking to me in person not direct messaging me.)

### STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES

* Come to class on time and participate actively in discussions (be present and engaged)
* Study outside of class (ideally with classmate(s))
* Schedule your time (keep a calendar of some sort)
* Devote **at least 4 to 8 hours** per week outside of class, fulfilling homework assignments, reading, and reflecting.
* Consult slack at least once a week for up to date info
* Complete all assignments by due dates
* Action – do your absolute best
* Strive for continuous improvement
* Have desire amounting to enthusiasm (to learn, to explore)
* Have patience, persistence, and discipline
* Be creative
* Pay attention to detail & craft
* Have self-confidence and pride in your work
* Take risks & be fearless in your projects
* Have fun!

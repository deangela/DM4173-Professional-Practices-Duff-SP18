# Obituary or Eulogy

* Using your [goals](goals.md) and [values](values.md), write two different versions of your own obituary or eulogy and post within [your google drive folder for this class](deliverables.md) as **obituary(or eulogy)_yourname should** and **obituary(or eulogy)_yourname must**. 
    * How do you want to be remembered? _Who_ do you want to be known as **being**?
    * What legacy do you want to leave behind? _What_ do you want to be known for **doing**?
* One version of your obituary or eulogy will be the life that you're headed for on your current path. Your should.
* The other version of your obituary or eulogy will be the life that you desire. Your must.
* IF your shoulds and musts are the same, you'll only have one version of your obituary or eulogy.
* Choose one of your obituaries or eulogies: should vs. must unless your shoulds and musts are the same.
* You will use your obituary or eulogy to develop your personal 1-Year and semester plans.

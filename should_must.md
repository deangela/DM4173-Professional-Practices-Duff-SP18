# ASSIGNMENT: SHOULD VS. MUST

_"To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best day and night to make you like everybody else means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight– but never stop fighting."_ - e. e. cummings 

_"Most people don't aim too high and miss. They aim too low and hit."_ ~Bob Moawad

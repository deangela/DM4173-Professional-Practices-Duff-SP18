# Fact-finding Interview

Seek out and meet in person or virtually via skype with one professional in your field of interest to learn about that field, the individual’s story and career path, the specific requirements and possibilities of the field, and any general words of wisdom about pursuing that path.

This is an informational interview. It is not for the purpose of getting anything. In other words, you should not be asking for a job. You should be looking for advice or inspiration.

# Midterm & Final Self Assessments

---

Any action without reflection is meaningless. Real learning only occurs as part of a reflective process. Reflection is studying your own practice as seriously as you study anything. It involves thinking about why, what, and how you create something. In any learning situation you should study beforehand, make/do, debug, reflect, adjust, and do it all over again. Learning happens in a cycle.

There will be two self assessments for the course. One will be due at midterm and the other at the end of the semester. They will be handed out in class as well as pinned on slack. These reflective writings will require you to critically evaluate your process and execution in the class.

**Each assessment should be direct messaged to the professor as a pdf on Slack or, if you fill out the paper copy, hand it in to the professor either during your one on one midterm appointment or on the last day of class.**

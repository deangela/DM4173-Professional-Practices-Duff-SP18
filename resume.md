# Resume

A resumé is an absolutely essential professional document that clearly and succinctly communicates your educational, creative, and professional experience and capabilities.

* Research and deconstruct (discuss pros and cons) of _at least_ 3 resumés in your chosen career path on your google drive folder in a folder **resume research** in [your google drive folder for this class](deliverables.md).
* Revise or create and iterate your resumé. You may need to do multiple depending on what you are applying for. Post to [your google drive folder for this class](deliverables.md) as **your_first_name your_last_name resume**. i.e. _De Angela L. Duff résume_.
* You should expect to constantly revise your resumé(s) over the course of the semester as needed.

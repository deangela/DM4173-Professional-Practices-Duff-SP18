# Goals

_"In the long run men only hit what they aim at. Therefore, though they should fail immediately, they had better aim at something high."_ ~ Henry David Thoreau

According to Dave Kohl, Professor Emeritus at Virginia Tech, people who regularly write down their goals earn nine times as much over their lifetimes as the people who don't.

* Write a list of your career goals. Be as specific and vivid as possible.
* You can go beyond your career goals and list whatever goals are currently on your mind in the following categories (not limited to):
    * Education
    * Finances
    * Health/Fitness
    * Family
    * Spiritual
    * Relationships
    * Travel
    * Creativity

* Post to [your google drive folder for this class](deliverables.md) in a file labeled either **your_name goals**.

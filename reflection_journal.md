# Reflection Journal

* You will be given a physical copy of a reflection journal.
* Reflect upon last year.
* Write in it over a series of days. 
* Try NOT to complete it in one sitting (definitely NOT the night before it is due).
* You will hand it in to the professor during the class that it's due.
* You will get it back by or before the end of the semester. 
* The journals will be locked up so that only the professor can read them.

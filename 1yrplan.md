# ASSIGNMENT: ONE-YEAR PLAN

_"You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. And YOU are the one who'll decide where to go..."_

~ Dr. Seuss, Oh, The Places You'll Go!

* Develop a comprehensive professional plan with key goals, milestones, practical considerations, and tasks that are oriented around a vision you have of yourself in a year.

* Who do you want to **be**?
* *Who* do you want to be surrounded by? *(Jim Rohn is quoted as saying that you are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.)*
* *Where* do you want to live?
* *What* do you want to **do**?
* What do you want to **have**?
* *How* will you plan the next year of your life by design, not by default?
* What is your personal definition of **success**?

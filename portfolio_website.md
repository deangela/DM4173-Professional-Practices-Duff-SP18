# Web Portfolio

* Research and deconstruct (discuss pros and cons) of _at least_ 3 resumés in your chosen career path on your google drive folder in a folder **web portfolio research** in [your google drive folder for this class](deliverables.md).
* Students will create a compelling web portfolio of creative work. 
* You may need to create more than one portfolio or web presences depending on your creative goals.
* I recommend you get your own domain name.
* Please edit the **Student URLs** note pinned on the pro_sp18 slack channel and list your name and portfolio URL.

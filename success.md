# Success

_"The tragedy of life doesn't lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach. It isn't a calamity to die with dreams unfulfilled, but it is a calamity not to dream...It is not a disgrace not to reach the stars, but it is a disgrace to have no stars to reach for."_ ~ Benjamin E. Mays


According to Dave Kohl, Professor Emeritus at Virginia Tech, people who regularly write down their goals earn nine times as much over their lifetimes as the people who don't.

    * Education
